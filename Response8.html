        <h1>The Good Room</h1>
        <p>Modernity seems to be steering completely towards oversimplification, utility and convenience. Every website has UX rules that seem as though "set-in-stone" if your navigation buttons aren't placed in the same spot as everywhere else, people get confused. If you're a store and you don't have filters, "good luck". And this happens not only on the web, but in real life as well. Every new apartment building looks the same! They all truly just renovate factories - have the same appliances, cupboards and finishings. It's like a cookie-cutter world. What happened to the value of architectural wonders? What happened to appreciating variety, innovation and uniquenesss? I hope the websites I create can walk that fine-line between accessibility or convenience, and expression and innovation.</p>
