                                        <p>2x5, 2x10 (2 heavy sets, 2 working sets) current weight: 65 lbs.</p>
                                        <p>First time barbell-front squatting ~ever~. I like them. They are considerably more taxing on the upper body than regular back squats. Particularly the chest, the core, and shoulders. I can only do a fraction of my regular load. Still, as a person with long femurs, having the workload be offset by my center of gravity at the front helps me achieve full range of motion while keeping an upright torso during the movement. I will alternate between front squats and back squats during my leg days to build strength in this new movement while also maintaining my strength on back squats while keeping them in the rotation.</p>

                                        <p>3x15 current weight: 40 lbs</p>
                                        <p>I like to keep the load light for this movement, though I am overloading little by little. I have opted for 20 lb dumbbells instead of my usual 15s. I prioritize control and stretch during this movement, as I use this for a warm up for my heavy pressings. I target my whole quad with an upright torso. I did not notice anything out of the ordinary other than more control at this slightly heavier weight.</p>

                                        <p>4x8-10. Current weight: 470 lbs</p>
                                        <p>We are back friends. I am in a cut right now, and being on a 300-500 calorie deficit is really taxing on my recovery. Though I am pleased to say: I can rep out 470 lbs comfortably this week. I will take this win, as this was the heaviest weight I was able to press during the peak of my bulk (more like main-gain, but potato, potahto) Though I know strength will ebb and flow, hey, I still got it.

                                        <p>4x10-15 Current weight: 70 lbs</p>
                                        <p> I do not like this machine. I hate it. But I hate the back pain that comes from the smith machine calf raises way more, so, it gets the job done. I added 25 lbs this week over what I usually do (just a 45 lb plate). Stretch was good, knee pressure? Bearable. But, how I wish I could do these on a leg press more often.</p>

(<s>I do nott care, I still wanted to do it, it is my split, not yours, if you do not want to do this, do not, see if I care, bye</s>)

                                        <p>Classic. Foot positioning matters. I have noticed my vastus lateralis has been working over time, so I made an effort to point my feet straight this time. I can confirm I felt it over the entire quad, so. Please, give it a try.</p>

                                        <p>Decent leg day! I burned 453 calories in 1 hour and 20 minutes (allegedly, I mean, how accurate are these watches anyways?) though, I will say, since I was in zone 2-3 during the workout, it shows it was rather intense for a weightlifting session. I felt strong in my heavy compounds (namely, leg press and hip-thrusts), despite being on a cut. I also had fun trying the front-loaded squats. I am excited to incorporate them into my lifts and progress in them. I think they will be beneficial to my upper body strength as well.</p>
