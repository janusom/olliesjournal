                                Hey there, everyone! I am Ollie, and you probably know me because you took a class with me, and you inevitably found out that I am obsessed with bodybuilding. If not, what are you doing here? Go away! <br><br>
                                I am joking. Anyways, welcome!<br><br>
                                In here you will find the original "BUILDING BODIES" booklet in downloadable form. "BUILDING BODIES: the basics" attempted to summarize bodybuilding as a process, lifestyle and sport to the most simple of terms, in order to introduce new people into it. This website is the continuation of it.</p>
                                <p style="font-family: avenir-black;"><br><br>
                                "BUILDING BODIES" sees bodybuildng not as a sport, but as a craft, and the evaluation of it. With the builder being a sculptor, and their body, the sculpture. I aim to highlight how committing to such a craft requires a lifestyle devoted in its entirety to build and display the self. An all-cosuming endeavor A bodybuilder is both author and product, joint as one: a package, displayed on stage. <br><br>
                                In this website you can find a pritable version of "BUILDING BODIES: the basics", stickers/temporary tattoos, pictures of my friends as beefcakes, and miscelaneous articles that I've written about bodybuilding.</p>

                                <p style="font-family: avenir-black;"> So, why are you into bodybuilding?</p>
                                <p style="font-family: avenir-book;">

                                This year I truly attempted to live the style of this people - cutting to the lowest body fat% I have ever been so far. Only to then bulk and cut again: a never ending cycle I am willing to undergo for my own goals<br><br>

                                But truly, this endeavor is not for everyone, and it can be very daunting at times. All consuming, ever-demanding, and truly lonely.<br><br>

                                As the Fitness industry grows, and niches online seem to grow beyond their original audiences, Bodybuilding has gained more exposure than ever. And chances are that you or someone you know may be comparing yourselves to bodybuilders, without truly knowing how long it took to look the way they do, what they did (and more than likely, took as well)
                                <br><br>

                                And so, out of blissful ignorance and naivity, you may dive into resistance training, hoping to change your body as much as your favorite athlete did... Following some mainstram advice from some "DR" of physiology at best, or some random bro/sis on tiktok at worst; only to end-up overtrained, without a lot of progress, and spinning your wheels.
                                <br><br>

                                Well, since I got nothing better to do, I will use this website to gather all the resources I have found so far to be reliable/interesting. Just so you can, hopefully, save yourself some disillusions.
