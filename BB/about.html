                                Hey there, everyone! I am Ollie, and you probably know me because you took a class with me, and you inevitably found out that I am obsessed with bodybuilding. If not, what are you doing here? Go away! <br><br>
                                I am joking. Anyways, welcome!<br><br>
                                In here you will find the original "BUILDING BODIES" booklet in downloadable form. "BUILDING BODIES: the basics" attempted to summarize bodybuilding as a process, lifestyle and sport to the most simple of terms, in order to introduce new people into it. This website is the continuation of it.</p>
                                <p style="font-family: avenir-black;"><br><br>
                                "BUILDING BODIES" sees bodybuildng not as a sport, but as a craft, and the evaluation of it. With the builder being a sculptor, and their body, the sculpture. I aim to highlight how committing to such a craft requires a lifestyle devoted in its entirety to build and display the self. An all-cosuming endeavor A bodybuilder is both author and product, joint as one: a package, displayed on stage.</p>
                                <br><br>

                                In this website you can find a pritable version of "BUILDING BODIES: the basics", stickers/temporary tattoos, pictures of my friends as beefcakes, and miscelaneous articles that I've written about bodybuilding.
