        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
        <p>Something I particularly admired about this reading is its attention to the impersonality of the current web. Every website I habitually use is run by a huge corporation. Across platforms, most websites look and operate the same, with very small changes. This is mostly due to the code of these websites being written by AI or with assistance from automation. The human hand has been lost, leaving these sterile, cookie-cutter formats that users have become accustomed to. Every social media site relies on the same skeuomorphisms, the time-line progression, and feed format. Even the aesthetic choices have been reduced to the same, one main brand color, minimal interface design, and dark mode. It’s come to the point where any small deviation from this appearance and interface can cause “distrust”. As it is mentioned in the reading, this familiarity even further takes people away from “the web”. According to QUARTZ, in 2015, Indonesians were surveyed about their internet use, and they drew a perceived difference between Facebook and the Web. Most surveyed users claimed they didn’t use the internet, but they did use facebook. This may have been from the migration from web browsers to applications, but still, these applications utilize the web. The source code is simply hidden. Packaged differently, and further distancing the user from the environment they are in. My question is, going back to trust, how could you trust a website to host your information, when by design, it’s hiding the very thing that could help you understand the way it operates? This question in particular, has made me appreciate the art of handmade web even further. As J.R Carpenter mentions, what better way to show take back ownership of your own identity than coding your own website, and having complete control over its policies?</p>
