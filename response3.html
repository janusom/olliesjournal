        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p> 
            I enjoyed the parallels made between computer diagrams and cities - how similar they are in their depiction and design but also their core differences.<br>

            Cities and computers are similar in the breakdown of processes for their standardization and optimization. Streets are designed for optimized traffic (hopefully), the same way a computer diagram is visually designed to facilitate the understanding of the workflow of a computational system by reducing to simple digestible chunks akin to streets. That’s why a map of a city and a computer look similar. However, city life goes beyond that, and the inner workings of a computer system are more technical and difficult than the diagram.<br>
                
            However, cities and computers are intrinsically different. A computer is a machine designed to perform a task, cities are the result of human cooperation, but they aren’t programmed as no human being can be truly forced to operate within a set, predictable framework.
