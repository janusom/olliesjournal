Avoid eye contact and ignore his gestures and shouting.<br><br> This is just me copying and pasting something from the <a href="https://transactions.dmv.virginia.gov/dmv-manuals/#/manual/1/section/3/subsection/3.8">DMV</a>, <i>I mean I am taking a bunch of quizes and it's the only thing I have easily avialable to copy text from.</i></p> 

        <p>Anyways, I need more text I think, so I am writing some myself. I don't really have much to say, other than that... I mean, did anything interesting happen today anyways? I guess, like... I really like multi II.</p>
