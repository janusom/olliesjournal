            <p>This is how it felt to read through this. I appreciated how each paragraph and segments of them would be animated allowing me to pace my reading in accordance. I think it proved its claim about the important role in pacing and how much more contextual written communication is nowadays. It's also made me ponder about the evolution of language and speech because of instant messaging.</p>
